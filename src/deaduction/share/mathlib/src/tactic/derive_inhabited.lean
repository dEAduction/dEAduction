# Derive handler for `inhabited` instances

This file introduces a derive handle to automatically generate `inhabited`
instances for structures and inductives. We also add various `inhabited`
instances for types in the core library.

namespace tactic

/--
Tries to derive an `inhabited` instance for inductives and structures.

For example:
```
@[derive inhabited]
structure foo :=
(a : ℕ := 42)
(b : list ℕ)
```
Here, `@[derive inhabited]` adds the instance `foo.inhabited`, which is defined as
`⟨⟨42, default (list ℕ)⟩⟩`.  For inductives, the default value is the first constructor.

If the structure/inductive has a type parameter `α`, then the generated instance will have an
argument `inhabited α`, even if it is not used.  (This is due to the implementation using
`instance_derive_handler`.)
