# Connected category

Define a connected category as a _nonempty_ category for which every functor
to a discrete category is isomorphic to the constant functor.

NB. Some authors include the empty category as connected, we do not.
We instead are interested in categories with exactly one 'connected
component'.

We give some equivalent definitions:
- A nonempty category for which every functor to a discrete category is
  constant on objects.
  See `any_functor_const_on_obj` and `connected.of_any_functor_const_on_obj`.
- A nonempty category for which every function `F` for which the presence of a
  morphism `f : j₁ ⟶ j₂` implies `F j₁ = F j₂` must be constant everywhere.
  See `constant_of_preserves_morphisms` and `connected.of_constant_of_preserves_morphisms`.
- A nonempty category for which any subset of its elements containing the
  default and closed under morphisms is everything.
  See `induct_on_objects` and `connected.of_induct`.
- A nonempty category for which every object is related under the reflexive
  transitive closure of the relation "there is a morphism in some direction
  from `j₁` to `j₂`".
  See `connected_zigzag` and `zigzag_connected`.
- A nonempty category for which for any two objects there is a sequence of
  morphisms (some reversed) from one to the other.
  See `exists_zigzag'` and `connected_of_zigzag`.

We also prove the result that the functor given by `(X × -)` preserves any
connected limit. That is, any limit of shape `J` where `J` is a connected
category is preserved by the functor `(X × -)`.

We define a connected category as a _nonempty_ category for which every
functor to a discrete category is constant.

NB. Some authors include the empty category as connected, we do not.
We instead are interested in categories with exactly one 'connected
component'.

This allows us to show that the functor X ⨯ - preserves connected limits.

If `J` is connected, then given any function `F` such that the presence of a
morphism `j₁ ⟶ j₂` implies `F j₁ = F j₂`, we have that `F` is constant.
This can be thought of as a local-to-global property.

`J` is connected if: given any function `F : J → α` which is constant for any

An inductive-like property for the objects of a connected category.
