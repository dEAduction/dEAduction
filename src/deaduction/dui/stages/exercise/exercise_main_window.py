class ExerciseMainWindow(QMainWindow):
    # TODO: explain better communication and who talks to who?
    """
    This class is responsible for both:
        - managing the whole interface for exercises;
        - communicating with a so-called server interface (self.servint, not
          instantiated in this class): a middle man between the interface and
          L∃∀N.

    User interface, server interface and L∃∀N server are different entities
    which remain separated by design; Qt signals and slots are used for
    communication between them. For the interface, self instantiates
    ExerciseCentralWidget, a toolbar, and probably more things in the future.
    For the communication with self.servint, self:
        1. stores user selection of math. objects or properties
           (self.current_selection);
        2. detects when an action button (in self.ecw.logic_btns or
           in self.ecw.proof_btns) or a statement (in
           self.ecw.statements_tree) is clicked on;
        3. sends (the current goal, current selection) and ((clicked
           action button (with self.__server_call_action)) xor (clicked
           statement (with self.__server_call_statement))) to the server
           interface;
        4. waits for some response (e.g. a new goal, an exception asking
           for new user parameters).
    As said, this class both sends and receives data to / from a server
    interface.
        - Sending data to the server inteface (self.servint) is achieved
          in the method server_task with signals and slots. More
          precisely, this methods receives signals (async with
          qtrio.enter_emissions_channel(signals …)) and calls functions
          / methods accordingly. Beware that this is not exactly Qt's
          native signals / slots mechanism.
        - Receiving data from the server interface achieved with signals
          and slots. Such signals are simply connected to Qt Slots in
          self.__init__; this is much simpler than sending data.

    Finally, all of this uses asynchronous processes (keywords async and
    await) using trio and qtrio.

    :attribute exercise Exercise: The instance of the Exercise class
        representing the exercise to be solved by the user, instantiated
        in deaduction.dui.__main__.py.
    :attribute current_goal Goal: The current goal, which contains the
        tagged target, tagged math. objects and tagged math. properties.
    :attribute current_selection [MathObjectWidgetItem]: The ordered of
        currently selected math. objects and properties by the user.
    :attribute ecw ExerciseCentralWidget: The instance of
        ExerciseCentralWidget instantiated in self.__init__, see
        ExerciseCentraiWidget.__doc__.
    :attribute lean_editor LeanEditor: A text editor to live-edit lean
        code.
    :attribute servint ServerInterface: The instance of ServerInterface
        for the session, instantiated in deaduction.dui.__main__.py.
    :attribute toolbar QToolBar: The toolbar.
    :attribute journal Journal: used to store the list of all events
        occurring in the interface, both practical and logical.
    :attribute exercise_solved bool: initialised to False, becomes True the
        first time target is solved.
    :attribute test_mode bool: True when auto testing.
    :attribute proof_step ProofStep: this class store all the data of the
        current proof step : user selection, button or statement triggered,
        user_input, CodeForLean, success or error msgs, and proof_state. It
        also stores memories of the proof, in particular the goal counters.
    :attribute displayed_proof_step ProofStep: This contains data of the
        ProofStep that was previously displayed by the ui. This ProofStep is
        not necessarily the previous proof step in the logical order,
        in case of undoing: the logically previous step is stored in the
        lean_file and may be retrieved using the logically_previous_proof_step
         property.
