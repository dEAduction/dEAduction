This is a bit of a hack: we manually inspect the proof that `rewrite_core` produced, and deduce from
that whether or not the entire expression was rewritten.-/

/-- Function which tries to perform the rewrite associated to the equality `r : expr × bool` (the
bool indicates whether we should flip the equality first), at the position pointed to by
`l : expr_lens`, by rewriting `e : expr`. If this succeeds, `rewrite_at_lens` computes (by unwinding
`l`) a proof that the entire expression represented by `l.fill e` is equal to the entire expression
`l.fill f`, where `f` is the `expr` which has replaced `e` due to the rewrite. It then returns the
singleton list containing this rewrite (and the tracking data needed to reconstruct it directly). If
it fails, it just returns the empty list. -/
