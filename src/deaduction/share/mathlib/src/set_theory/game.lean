# Combinatorial games.

In this file we define the quotient of pre-games by the equivalence relation `p ≈ q ↔ p ≤ q ∧ q ≤
p`, and construct an instance `add_comm_group game`, as well as an instance `partial_order game`
(although note carefully the warning that the `<` field in this instance is not the usual relation
on combinatorial games).

/-- The type of combinatorial games. In ZFC, a combinatorial game is constructed from
  two sets of combinatorial games that have been constructed at an earlier
  stage. To do this in type theory, we say that a combinatorial pre-game is built
  inductively from two families of combinatorial games indexed over any type
  in Type u. The resulting type `pgame.{u}` lives in `Type (u+1)`,
  reflecting that it is a proper class in ZFC.
  A combinatorial game is then constructed by quotienting by the equivalence
  `x ≈ y ↔ x ≤ y ∧ y ≤ x`. -/

-- While it is very tempting to define a `partial_order` on games, and prove
-- that games form an `ordered_add_comm_group`, it is a bit dangerous.

-- The relations `≤` and `<` on games do not satisfy
-- `lt_iff_le_not_le : ∀ a b : α, a < b ↔ (a ≤ b ∧ ¬ b ≤ a)`
-- (Consider `a = 0`, `b = star`.)
-- (`lt_iff_le_not_le` is satisfied by surreal numbers, however.)
-- Thus we can not use `<` when defining a `partial_order`.

-- Because of this issue, we define the `partial_order` and `ordered_add_comm_group` instances,
-- but do not actually mark them as instances, for safety.
