This file imports many useful tactics ("the kitchen sink").

You can use `import tactic` at the beginning of your file to get everything.
(Although you may want to strip things down when you're polishing.)

Because this file imports some complicated tactics, it has many transitive dependencies
(which of course may not use `import tactic`, and must import selectively).

As (non-exhaustive) examples, these includes things like:
* algebra.group_power
* algebra.ordered_ring
* data.rat
* data.nat.prime
* data.list.perm
* data.set.lattice
* data.equiv.encodable
* order.complete_lattice
