# The Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure

The Fourier-Motzkin procedure is a variable elimination method for linear inequalities.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier%E2%80%93Motzkin_elimination>

Given a set of linear inequalities `comps = {tᵢ Rᵢ 0}`,
we aim to eliminate a single variable `a` from the set.
We partition `comps` into `comps_pos`, `comps_neg`, and `comps_zero`,
where `comps_pos` contains the comparisons `tᵢ Rᵢ 0` in which
the coefficient of `a` in `tᵢ` is positive, and similar.

For each pair of comparisons `tᵢ Rᵢ 0 ∈ comps_pos`, `tⱼ Rⱼ 0 ∈ comps_neg`,
we compute coefficients `vᵢ, vⱼ ∈ ℕ` such that `vᵢ*tᵢ + vⱼ*tⱼ` cancels out `a`.
We collect these sums `vᵢ*tᵢ + vⱼ*tⱼ R' 0` in a set `S` and set `comps' = S ∪ comps_zero`,
a new set of comparisons in which `a` has been eliminated.

Theorem: `comps` and `comps'` are equisatisfiable.

We recursively eliminate all variables from the system. If we derive an empty clause `0 < 0`,
we conclude that the original system was unsatisfiable.

### Datatypes

The `comp_source` and `pcomp` datatypes are specific to the FM elimination routine;
they are not shared with other components of `linarith`.
-/

/--
`comp_source` tracks the source of a comparison.
The atomic source of a comparison is an assumption, indexed by a natural number.
Two comparisons can be added to produce a new comparison,
and one comparison can be scaled by a natural number to produce a new comparison.

| add : comp_source → comp_source → comp_source
| scale : ℕ → comp_source → comp_source

/--
Given a `comp_source` `cs`, `cs.flatten` maps an assumption index
to the number of copies of that assumption that appear in the history of `cs`.

For example, suppose `cs` is produced by scaling assumption 2 by 5,
and adding to that the sum of assumptions 1 and 2.
`cs.flatten` maps `1 ↦ 1, 2 ↦ 6`.

/--
A `pcomp` stores a linear comparison `Σ cᵢ*xᵢ R 0`,
along with information about how this comparison was derived.
The original expressions fed into `linarith` are each assigned a unique natural number label.
The *historical set* `pcomp.history` stores the labels of expressions
that were used in deriving the current `pcomp`.
Variables are also indexed by natural numbers. The sets `pcomp.effective`, `pcomp.implicit`,
and `pcomp.vars` contain variable indices.
* `pcomp.vars` contains the variables that appear in `pcomp.c`. We store them in `pcomp` to
  avoid recomputing the set, which requires folding over a list. (TODO: is this really needed?)
* `pcomp.effective` contains the variables that have been effectively eliminated from `pcomp`.
  A variable `n` is said to be *effectively eliminated* in `pcomp` if the elimination of `n`
  produced at least one of the ancestors of `pcomp`.
* `pcomp.implicit` contains the variables that have been implicitly eliminated from `pcomp`.
  A variable `n` is said to be *implicitly eliminated* in `pcomp` if it satisfies the following
  properties:
  - There is some `ancestor` of `pcomp` such that `n` appears in `ancestor.vars`.
  - `n` does not appear in `pcomp.vars`.
  - `n` was not effectively eliminated.

We track these sets in order to compute whether the history of a `pcomp` is *minimal*.
Checking this directly is expensive, but effective approximations can be defined in terms of these
sets. During the variable elimination process, a `pcomp` with non-minimal history can be discarded.

/--
Any comparison whose history is not minimal is redundant,
and need not be included in the new set of comparisons.
`elimed_ge : ℕ` is a natural number such that all variables with index ≥ `elimed_ge` have been
removed from the system.

This test is an overapproximation to minimality. It gives necessary but not sufficient conditions.
If the history of `c` is minimal, then `c.maybe_minimal` is true,
but `c.maybe_minimal` may also be true for some `c` with minimal history.
Thus, if `c.maybe_minimal` is false, `c` is known not to be minimal and must be redundant.
See http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.51.493&rep=rep1&type=pdf p.13
(Theorem 7).
The condition described there considers only implicitly eliminated variables that have been
officially eliminated from the system. This is not the case for every implicitly eliminated variable.
Consider eliminating `z` from `{x + y + z < 0, x - y - z < 0}`. The result is the set
`{2*x < 0}`; `y` is implicitly but not officially eliminated.

This implementation of Fourier-Motzkin elimination processes variables in decreasing order of
indices. Immediately after a step that eliminates variable `k`, variable `k'` has been eliminated
iff `k' ≥ k`. Thus we can compute the intersection of officially and implicitly eliminated variables
by taking the set of implicitly eliminated variables with indices ≥ `elimed_ge`.

`pcomp.add c1 c2 elim_var` creates the result of summing the linear comparisons `c1` and `c2`,
during the process of eliminating the variable `elim_var`.
The computation assumes, but does not enforce, that `elim_var` appears in both `c1` and `c2`
and does not appear in the sum.
Computing the sum of the two comparisons is easy; the complicated details lie in tracking the
additional fields of `pcomp`.
* The historical set `pcomp.history` of `c1 + c2` is the union of the two historical sets.
* We recompute the variables that appear in `c1 + c2` from the newly created `linexp`,
  since some may have been implicitly eliminated.
* The effectively eliminated variables of `c1 + c2` are the union of the two effective sets,
  with `elim_var` inserted.
* The implicitly eliminated variables of `c1 + c2` are those that appear in at least one of
  `c1.vars` and `c2.vars` but not in `(c1 + c2).vars`, excluding `elim_var`.

`pelim_var p1 p2` calls `elim_var` on the `comp` components of `p1` and `p2`.

and tracks this in the `comp_source`.

`produce_certificate hyps vars` tries to derive a contradiction from the comparisons in `hyps`
