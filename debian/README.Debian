dEAduction for Debian
=====================

Ugly debian packaging rules for dEAduction. Install Python dependendencies
at build time in a virtual environment (using wheels...), install dEAduction in the virtual
environment and add launcher and icon. Lean and mathlib dependencies
are included in the Python package deaduction.
