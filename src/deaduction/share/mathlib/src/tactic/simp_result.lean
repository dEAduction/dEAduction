# simp_result

`dsimp_result` and `simp_result` are a pair of tactics for
applying `dsimp` or `simp` to the result produced by other tactics.

As examples, tactics which use `revert` and `intro`
may insert additional `id` terms in the result they produce.
If there is some reason these are undesirable
(e.g. the result term needs to be human-readable, or
satisfying syntactic rather than just definitional properties),
wrapping those tactics in `dsimp_result`
can remove the `id` terms "after the fact".

Similarly, tactics using `subst` and `rw` will nearly always introduce `eq.rec` terms,
but sometimes these will be easy to remove,
for example by simplifying using `eq_rec_constant`.
This is a non-definitional simplification lemma,
and so wrapping these tactics in `simp_result` will result
in a definitionally different result.

There are several examples in the associated test file,
demonstrating these interactions with `revert` and `subst`.

These tactics should be used with some caution.
You should consider whether there is any real need for the simplification of the result,
and whether there is a more direct way of producing the result you wanted,
before relying on these tactics.

Both are implemented in terms of a generic `intercept_result` tactic,
which allows you to run an arbitrary tactic and modify the returned results.

`intercept_result m t`
attempts to run a tactic `t`,
intercepts any results `t` assigns to the goals,
and runs `m : expr → tactic expr` on each of the expressions
before assigning the returned values to the original goals.

Because `intercept_result` uses `unsafe.type_context.assign` rather than `unify`,
if the tactic `m` does something unreasonable
you may produce terms that don't typecheck,
possibly with mysterious error messages.
Be careful!

`dsimp_result { tac }`
attempts to run a tactic block `tac`,
intercepts any results the tactic block would have assigned to the goals,
and runs `dsimp` on those results
before assigning the simplified values to the original goals.

You can use the usual interactive syntax for `dsimp`, e.g.
`dsimp_result only [a, b, c] with attr { tac }`.

`dsimp_result { tac }` works similarly, internally using `dsimp`
(and so only simplifiying along definitional lemmas).
