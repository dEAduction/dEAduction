# `linarith`: solving linear arithmetic goals

`linarith` is a tactic for solving goals with linear arithmetic.

Suppose we have a set of hypotheses in `n` variables
`S = {a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + ... + aₙxₙ R b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ... + bₙxₙ}`,
where `R ∈ {<, ≤, =, ≥, >}`.
Our goal is to determine if the inequalities in `S` are jointly satisfiable, that is, if there is
an assignment of values to `x₁, ..., xₙ` such that every inequality in `S` is true.

Specifically, we aim to show that they are *not* satisfiable. This amounts to proving a
contradiction. If our goal is also a linear inequality, we negate it and move it to a hypothesis
before trying to prove `false`.

When the inequalities are over a dense linear order, `linarith` is a decision procedure: it will
prove `false` if and only if the inequalities are unsatisfiable. `linarith` will also run on some
types like `ℤ` that are not dense orders, but it will fail to prove `false` on some unsatisfiable
problems. It will run over concrete types like `ℕ`, `ℚ`, and `ℝ`, as well as abstract types that
are instances of `linear_ordered_comm_ring`.

## Algorithm sketch

First, the inequalities in the set `S` are rearranged into the form `tᵢ Rᵢ 0`, where
`Rᵢ ∈ {<, ≤, =}` and each `tᵢ` is of the form `∑ cⱼxⱼ`.

`linarith` uses an untrusted oracle to search for a certificate of unsatisfiability.
The oracle searches for a list of natural number coefficients `kᵢ` such that `∑ kᵢtᵢ = 0`, where for
at least one `i`, `kᵢ > 0` and `Rᵢ = <`.

Given a list of such coefficients, `linarith` verifies that `∑ kᵢtᵢ = 0` using a normalization
tactic such as `ring`. It proves that `∑ kᵢtᵢ < 0` by transitivity, since each component of the sum
is either equal to, less than or equal to, or less than zero by hypothesis. This produces a
contradiction.

## Preprocessing

`linarith` does some basic preprocessing before running. Most relevantly, inequalities over natural
numbers are cast into inequalities about integers, and rational division by numerals is canceled
into multiplication. We do this so that we can guarantee the coefficients in the certificate are
natural numbers, which allows the tactic to solve goals over types that are not fields.

## Fourier-Motzkin elimination

The oracle implemented to search for certificates uses Fourier-Motzkin variable elimination.
This technique transorms a set of inequalities in `n` variables to an equisatisfiable set in `n - 1`
variables. Once all variables have been eliminated, we conclude that the original set was
unsatisfiable iff the comparison `0 < 0` is in the resulting set.

While performing this elimination, we track the history of each derived comparison. This allows us
to represent any comparison at any step as a positive combination of comparisons from the original
set. In particular, if we derive `0 < 0`, we can find our desired list of coefficients
by counting how many copies of each original comparison appear in the history.

## Implementation details

`linarith` homogenizes numerical constants: the expression `1` is treated as a variable `t₀`.

Often `linarith` is called on goals that have comparison hypotheses over multiple types. This
creates multiple `linarith` problems, each of which is handled separately; the goal is solved as
soon as one problem is found to be contradictory.

Disequality hypotheses `t ≠ 0` do not fit in this pattern. `linarith` will attempt to prove equality
goals by splitting them into two weak inequalities and running twice. But it does not split
disequality hypotheses, since this would lead to a number of runs exponential in the number of
disequalities in the context.

The Fourier-Motzkin oracle is very modular. It can easily be replaced with another function of type
`list comp → ℕ → option (rb_map ℕ ℕ)`, which takes a list of comparisons and the largest variable
index appearing in those comparisons, and returns a map from comparison indices to coefficients.
Because we do not expect another oracle to be available any time soon, there is no convenient hook
to replace it, but doing so requires only a few lines of code to change.

A variant, `nlinarith`, adds an extra preprocessing step to handle some basic nonlinear goals.
There is a hook in the `linarith_config` configuration object to add custom preprocessing routines.

The certificate checking step is *not* by reflection. `linarith` converts the certificate into a
proof term of type `false`.

Some of the behavior of `linarith` can be inspected with the option
`set_option trace.linarith true`.
Because the variable elimination happens outside the tactic monad, we cannot trace intermediate
steps there.

## File structure

The components of `linarith` are spread between a number of files for the sake of organization.

* `lemmas.lean` contains proofs of some arithmetic lemmas that are used in preprocessing and in
  verification.
* `datatypes.lean` contains data structures that are used across multiple files, along with some
  useful auxiliary functions.
* `preprocessing.lean` contains functions used at the beginning of the tactic to transform
  hypotheses into a shape suitable for the main routine.
* `parsing.lean` contains functions used to compute the linear structure of an expression.
* `elimination.lean` contains the Fourier-Motzkin elimination routine.
* `verification.lean` contains the certificate checking functions that produce a proof of `false`.
* `frontend.lean` contains the control methods and user-facing components of the tactic.

If `e` is a comparison `a R b` or the negation of a comparison `¬ a R b`, found in the target,
`get_contr_lemma_name_and_type e` returns the name of a lemma that will change the goal to an
implication, along with the type of `a` and `b`.

For example, if `e` is `(a : ℕ) < b`, returns ``(`lt_of_not_ge, ℕ)``.

`apply_contr_lemma` inspects the target to see if it can be moved to a hypothesis by negation.
For example, a goal `⊢ a ≤ b` can become `a > b ⊢ false`.
If this is the case, it applies the appropriate lemma and introduces the new hypothesis.
It returns the type of the terms in the comparison (e.g. the type of `a` and `b` above) and the
newly introduced local constant.
Otherwise returns `none`.

Returns a map from a type to a list of comparisons over that type.

in the partition.

If `pref_type` is given, it will first use the class of proofs of comparisons over that type.

`linarith` attempts to find a contradiction between hypotheses that are linear (in)equalities.
Equivalently, it can prove a linear inequality by assuming its negation and proving `false`.

In theory, `linarith` should prove any goal that is true in the theory of linear arithmetic over
the rationals. While there is some special handling for non-dense orders like `nat` and `int`,
this tactic is not complete for these theories and will not prove every true goal. It will solve
goals over arbitrary types that instantiate `linear_ordered_comm_ring`.

An example:
```lean
example (x y z : ℚ) (h1 : 2*x  < 3*y) (h2 : -4*x + 2*z < 0)
        (h3 : 12*y - 4* z < 0)  : false :=
by linarith
```

`linarith` will use all appropriate hypotheses and the negation of the goal, if applicable.

`linarith [t1, t2, t3]` will additionally use proof terms `t1, t2, t3`.

`linarith only [h1, h2, h3, t1, t2, t3]` will use only the goal (if relevant), local hypotheses
`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and proofs `t1`, `t2`, `t3`. It will ignore the rest of the local context.

`linarith!` will use a stronger reducibility setting to try to identify atoms. For example,
```lean
example (x : ℚ) : id x ≥ x :=
by linarith
```
will fail, because `linarith` will not identify `x` and `id x`. `linarith!` will.
This can sometimes be expensive.

`linarith {discharger := tac, restrict_type := tp, exfalso := ff}` takes a config object with five
optional arguments:
* `discharger` specifies a tactic to be used for reducing an algebraic equation in the
  proof stage. The default is `ring`. Other options currently include `ring SOP` or `simp` for basic
  problems.
* `restrict_type` will only use hypotheses that are inequalities over `tp`. This is useful
  if you have e.g. both integer and rational valued inequalities in the local context, which can
  sometimes confuse the tactic.
* `transparency` controls how hard `linarith` will try to match atoms to each other. By default
  it will only unfold `reducible` definitions.
* If `split_hypotheses` is true, `linarith` will split conjunctions in the context into separate
  hypotheses.
* If `exfalso` is false, `linarith` will fail when the goal is neither an inequality nor `false`.
  (True by default.)

A variant, `nlinarith`, does some basic preprocessing to handle some nonlinear goals.

The option `set_option trace.linarith true` will trace certain intermediate stages of the `linarith`
routine.

/--
An extension of `linarith` with some preprocessing to allow it to solve some nonlinear arithmetic
problems. (Based on Coq's `nra` tactic.) See `linarith` for the available syntax of options,
which are inherited by `nlinarith`; that is, `nlinarith!` and `nlinarith only [h1, h2]` all work as
in `linarith`. The preprocessing is as follows:

* For every subterm `a ^ 2` or `a * a` in a hypothesis or the goal,
  the assumption `0 ≤ a ^ 2` or `0 ≤ a * a` is added to the context.
* For every pair of hypotheses `a1 R1 b1`, `a2 R2 b2` in the context, `R1, R2 ∈ {<, ≤, =}`,
  the assumption `0 R' (b1 - a1) * (b2 - a2)` is added to the context (non-recursively),
  where `R ∈ {<, ≤, =}` is the appropriate comparison derived from `R1, R2`.
