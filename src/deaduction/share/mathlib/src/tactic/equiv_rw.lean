# The `equiv_rw` tactic transports goals or hypotheses along equivalences.

The basic syntax is `equiv_rw e`, where `e : α ≃ β` is an equivalence.
This will try to replace occurrences of `α` in the goal with `β`, for example
transforming
* `⊢ α` to `⊢ β`,
* `⊢ option α` to `⊢ option β`
* `⊢ {a // P}` to `{b // P (⇑(equiv.symm e) b)}`

The tactic can also be used to rewrite hypotheses, using the syntax `equiv_rw e at h`.

## Implementation details

The main internal function is `equiv_rw_type e t`,
which attempts to turn an expression `e : α ≃ β` into a new equivalence with left hand side `t`.
As an example, with `t = option α`, it will generate `functor.map_equiv option e`.

This is achieved by generating a new synthetic goal `%%t ≃ _`,
and calling `solve_by_elim` with an appropriate set of congruence lemmas.
To avoid having to specify the relevant congruence lemmas by hand,
we mostly rely on `equiv_functor.map_equiv` and `bifunctor.map_equiv`
along with some structural congruence lemmas such as
* `equiv.arrow_congr'`,
* `equiv.subtype_equiv_of_subtype'`,
* `equiv.sigma_congr_left'`, and
* `equiv.Pi_congr_left'`.

The main `equiv_rw` function, when operating on the goal, simply generates a new equivalence `e'`
with left hand side matching the target, and calls `apply e'.inv_fun`.

When operating on a hypothesis `x : α`, we introduce a new fact `h : x = e.symm (e x)`,
revert this, and then attempt to `generalize`, replacing all occurrences of `e x` with a new constant `y`,
before `intro`ing and `subst`ing `h`, and renaming `y` back to `x`.

## Future improvements
In a future PR I anticipate that `derive equiv_functor` should work on many examples,
(internally using `transport`, which is in turn based on `equiv_rw`)
and we can incrementally bootstrap the strength of `equiv_rw`.

An ambitious project might be to add `equiv_rw!`,
a tactic which, when failing to find appropriate `equiv_functor` instances,
attempts to `derive` them on the spot.

For now `equiv_rw` is entirely based on `equiv`,
but the framework can readily be generalised to also work with other types of equivalences,
for example specific notations such as ring equivalence (`≃+*`),
or general categorical isomorphisms (`≅`).

This will allow us to transport across more general types of equivalences,
but this will wait for another subsequent PR.

  The default value is 10.

  you can rewrite `option (option α))` but not `option (option (option α))`.

    We now call `solve_by_elim` to try to generate the requested equivalence.
    There are a few subtleties!
    * We make sure that `eq` is the first lemma, so it is applied whenever possible.
    * In `equiv_congr_lemmas`, we put `equiv.refl` last so it is only used when it is not possible
      to descend further.
    * Since some congruence lemmas generate subgoals with `∀` statements,
      we use the `pre_apply` subtactic of `solve_by_elim` to preprocess each new goal with `intros`.

`equiv_rw e at h`, where `h : α` is a hypothesis, and `e : α ≃ β`,
will attempt to transport `h` along `e`, producing a new hypothesis `h : β`,
with all occurrences of `h` in other hypotheses and the goal replaced with `e.symm h`.

`equiv_rw e` will attempt to transport the goal along an equivalence `e : α ≃ β`.
In its minimal form it replaces the goal `⊢ α` with `⊢ β` by calling `apply e.inv_fun`.

`equiv_rw` will also try rewriting under (equiv_)functors, so can turn
a hypothesis `h : list α` into `h : list β` or
a goal `⊢ unique α` into `⊢ unique β`.

The maximum search depth for rewriting in subexpressions is controlled by
`equiv_rw e {max_depth := n}`.
