# actions_widgets_classes.py : exercise actions widgets #
#########################################################

    Provide widgets classes for an exercise's actions area, that is the
    two rows of action buttons (logic buttons and proof techniques
    buttons) and the so-called statements tree : course definitions,
    theorems and exercises used as theorems are displayed in a tree
    whose structure is that of the course. Those widgets will be
    instantiated in ExerciseCentralWidget, which itself will be
    instantiated as an attribute of ExerciseMainWindow. Provided
    classes:
        - ActionButton;
        - ActionButtonsWidget;
        - StatementsTreeWidgetNode;
        - StatementsTreeWidgetItem;
        - StatementsTreeWidget.

#################################

# Classes for the two rows of buttons (e.g. ∀ button) in the Actions
# area of the exercise window. Each button is coded as an instance of
# the class ActionButton and each row essentially is a container of
# instances of ActionButton coded as an instance of ActionButtonsWidget.


class ActionButton(QPushButton):

    Class for so-called 'action buttons' (e.g. '∀' button). Each
    instance of this class is associated to an instance of the class
    Action (self.action). This instance contains
    all information required by L∃∀N. Furthermore, each
    such instance also contains all required cosmetic information
    for the graphical interface, that is a symbol and a caption.
    Therefore, all one needs to instantiate ActionButton is an instance
    of the class Action.

           there on the current goal, optional current selection (user
           selected objects and properties) and self are pre-processed.
           If everything is ok, everything is sent to L∃∀N. Otherwise,
           additional info may be asked to the user, such as missing
           parameters.

    theorems and exercises. Note that statements pretty names (which
