    Provide StartCoExStartup and StartCoExExerciseFinished: dialogs used
    by usr at the start-up of the program and after an exercise is
    finisehd to choose, preview and start an exercise.

    The classes to be used elsewhere in the program are StartCoExStartup
    and StartCoExExerciseFinished (inherits QDialog). The other classes
    (AbstractCoExChooser, CourseChooser, ExerciseChooser) are meant to
    be used in this file only, for technical purposes.

    This class was made for technical purposes and is not to be used
    outside this file. In StartExerciseDialog, both the course chooser
    and the exercise chooser have the same structure:
    - a browser area (browse courses or browse exercices inside one
      course) on top;
    - a previewer area (preview the title, task, description, etc) on
      bottom.
    In other words, course and exercise choosers contain different
    widgets which are organized in the same way. Therefore, both
    CourseChooser and ExerciseChooser inherit from this class . It looks
    like this:

    |------------|
    |   browser  |
    |------------|
    |   preview  |
    |------------|

    For the details, the bowser part never changes and is instanciated
    at init (browser_layout passed as argument). On the opposite, there
    is a preview only if something (a course or exercise) has been
    chosen. This preview is set with the method set_preview. Now,
    CourseChooser and ExerciseChooser need to have their own
    sub-widgets. The way to do that here is to redefine __init__ (for
    the browser) and set_preview (for the preview), define the
    sub-widgets inside the definitions, and call super().__init__ and
    super().set_preview with the defined widgets.

    Finally, data such as the course being previewed is kept as private class
    atributes.

class AbstractStartCoEx(QDialog):
    """
    The base class course and exercise chooser (inherits QDialog); it is
    inherited by StartCoExStartup and
    StartCoExExerciseFinished, which are the classes instanciated
    elsewhere in the program. This abstract class was made because
    StartCoExStartup and StartCoExExerciseFinished are
    almost the same — this class could almost be instanciated as is
    (e.g. StartCoExStartup definition is very small).

    AbstractStartCoEx is divided in two main sub-widgets
    (presented in a QTabWidget): the course chooser
    (self.__course_chooser) and the exercise chooser
    (self.__exercise_chooser), see those choosers docstrings. At first,
    only the course chooser is enabled: usr browses courses. When usr
    selects a course, the course is previewed by calling the method
    self.__course_choser.set_preview, with the course as argument. An
    ExerciseChooser object is instanciated (self.__exercise_chooser) in
    a new tab and usr browses exercises.  When usr clicks on an
    exercise, this exercise is kept as is previewed by calling
    self.__exercise_chooser.set_preview with the exercise as argument
    (and the exercise is kept in self.__exercise_chooser.__exercise,
    accessible with a property).  Once usr confirms their choice of
    exercice, they click on the 'Start exercise' button, which closes
    the dialog and sends a signal to launch the exercice main window.

    This class also has a __preset_exercise method allowing to preset /
    preview a given exercise (see its docstring for specifics).

    The communication between this class, the two choosers and the rest
    of the program can be tricky and the actual solution is
    not-so-elegant; enhancements encouraged and welcome. For example,
    the 'Start exercise' button is not always enabled. At init, it is
    disabled and it is enabled when the user clicks on an exercise item
    in self.__exercise_chooser and the signal
    self.__exercise_chooser.exercise_previewed is emitted.
