# The `simp_rw` tactic

This module defines a tactic `simp_rw` which functions as a mix of `simp` and
`rw`. Like `rw`, it applies each rewrite rule in the given order, but like
`simp` it repeatedly applies these rules and also under binders like `∀ x, ...`,
`∃ x, ...` and `λ x, ...`.

## Implementation notes

The tactic works by taking each rewrite rule in turn and applying `simp only` to
it. Arguments to `simp_rw` are of the format used by `rw` and are translated to
their equivalents for `simp`.

`simp_rw` functions as a mix of `simp` and `rw`. Like `rw`, it applies each
rewrite rule in the given order, but like `simp` it repeatedly applies these
rules and also under binders like `∀ x, ...`, `∃ x, ...` and `λ x, ...`.

Usage:
  - `simp_rw [lemma_1, ..., lemma_n]` will rewrite the goal by applying the
    lemmas in that order. A lemma preceded by `←` is applied in the reverse direction.
  - `simp_rw [lemma_1, ..., lemma_n] at h₁ ... hₙ` will rewrite the given hypotheses.
  - `simp_rw [...] at ⊢ h₁ ... hₙ` rewrites the goal as well as the given hypotheses.
  - `simp_rw [...] at *` rewrites in the whole context: all hypotheses and the goal.

Lemmas passed to `simp_rw` must be expressions that are valid arguments to `simp`.

For example, neither `simp` nor `rw` can solve the following, but `simp_rw` can:
```lean
example {α β : Type} {f : α → β} {t : set β} : (∀ s, f '' s ⊆ t) = ∀ s : set α, ∀ x ∈ s, x ∈ f ⁻¹' t :=
by simp_rw [set.image_subset_iff, set.subset_def]
```
