# __init__.py : Provide the Journal class
    
The Journal class is designed to keep track of all events occurring in the
current proof. It is instantiated exactly once for a given proof. If the
journal.save parameter in the config file is True, then the journal content
is saved when the exercise window is closed.

The content is saved under two format:
(1) a 'pkl' file containing an instance of the Exercise class, with the
proof_steps saved in the refined_auto_step attribute. This file can be used
fo autotests.
(2) a 'txt' file which contains the logs of the proof, in which the successive
proof steps are presented, with context, target, and actions.
