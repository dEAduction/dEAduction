# __main__.py : pre-process all statements of a lean course file #
##################################################################

Allow the user to choose a lean file, and pre-process all statements,
sending them to Lean one by one to get their initial proof_state.
Each initial proof state is stored in the statement.initial_proof_state
attribute.

The resulting course is stored in a '.pkl' file in the same directory

If the corresponding '.pkl' file already exists, then
- if the file_content was different, just erase the '.pkl' file
- if not, read the stored course and keep the initial proof_states
that are already stored there.

Every 5 processed statements, Lean server is stopped and started again.
This prevents the Lean server from crashing because of messages of length
> 65535. The resulting course with partial pre-processing is also stored,
to take into account the possibility of a crash.

In practice, the software seldom succeeds in processing the whole content.
As said before, however, the statements that have already been processed are
still accessible. So in case of a crash, just run the soft again, and be
patient...

Finally the programme prints all statements, so this can also be used to get
the list of all statements in a given Lean (or pkl) course file.
