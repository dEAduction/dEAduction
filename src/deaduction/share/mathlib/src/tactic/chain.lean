This file defines a `chain` tactic, which takes a list of tactics, and exhaustively tries to apply them
to the goals, until no tactic succeeds on any goal.

Along the way, it generates auxiliary declarations, in order to speed up elaboration time
of the resulting (sometimes long!) proofs.

This tactic is used by the `tidy` tactic.

-- α is the return type of our tactics. When `chain` is called by `tidy`, this is string,
-- describing what that tactic did as an interactive tactic.
variable {α : Type}

/-
Because chain sometimes pauses work on the first goal and works on later goals, we need a method
for combining a list of results generated while working on a later goal into a single result.
This enables `tidy {trace_result := tt}` to output faithfully reproduces its operation, e.g.
````
intros,
simp,
apply lemma_1,
work_on_goal 2 {
  dsimp,
  simp
},
refl
````

`chain_many tac` recursively tries `tac` on all goals, working depth-first on generated subgoals,
until it no longer succeeds on any goal. `chain_many` automatically makes auxiliary definitions.
