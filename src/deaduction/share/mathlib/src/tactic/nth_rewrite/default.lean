# Advanced rewriting tactics

This file provides three interactive tactics
that give the user more control over where to perform a rewrite.

## Main definitions

* `nth_write n rules`: performs only the `n`th possible rewrite using the `rules`.
* `nth_rewrite_lhs`: as above, but only rewrites on the left hand side of an equation or iff.
* `nth_rewrite_rhs`: as above, but only rewrites on the right hand side of an equation or iff.

## Implementation details

There are two alternative backends, provided by `.congr` and `.kabstract`.
The kabstract backend is not currently available through mathlib.

The kabstract backend is faster, but if there are multiple identical occurrences of the
same rewritable subexpression, all are rewritten simultaneously,
and this isn't always what we want.
(In particular, `rewrite_search` is much less capable on the `category_theory` library.)

/-- `nth_rewrite n rules` performs only the `n`th possible rewrite using the `rules`.
The tactics `nth_rewrite_lhs` and `nth_rewrite_rhs` are variants
that operate on the left and right hand sides of an equation or iff.

Note: `n` is zero-based, so `nth_rewrite 0 h`
will rewrite along `h` at the first possible location.

In more detail, given `rules = [h1, ..., hk]`,
this tactic will search for all possible locations
where one of `h1, ..., hk` can be rewritten,
and perform the `n`th occurrence.

Example: Given a goal of the form `a + x = x + b`, and hypothesis `h : x = y`,
the tactic `nth_rewrite 1 h` will change the goal to `a + x = y + b`.

The core `rewrite` has a `occs` configuration setting intended to achieve a similar
purpose, but this doesn't really work. (If a rule matches twice, but with different
values of arguments, the second match will not be identified.) -/
