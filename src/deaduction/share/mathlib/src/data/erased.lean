# A type for VM-erased data

This file defines a type `erased α` which is classically isomorphic to `α`,
but erased in the VM. That is, at runtime every value of `erased α` is
represented as `0`, just like types and proofs.
-/

/-- `erased α` is the same as `α`, except that the elements
  of `erased α` are erased in the VM in the same way as types
  and proofs. This can be used to track data without storing it
  literally. -/
