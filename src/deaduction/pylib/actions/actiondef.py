###########################################################

Thanks to the action decorator, a dictionary of all action functions is
build. Then a button is created for each function.

To add a new action function:
    - create the function in action/logic or magic or proofs
    - add a tooltip in pylib/text/tooltips, and (for a logic button)
    the name in the logic_buttons list, and a default symbol in config.toml
    - adapt auto_steps module
