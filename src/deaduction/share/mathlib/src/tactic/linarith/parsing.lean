# Parsing input expressions into linear form

`linarith` computes the linear form of its input expressions,
assuming (without justification) that the type of these expressions
is a commutative semiring.
It identifies atoms up to ring-equivalence: that is, `(y*3)*x` will be identified `3*(x*y)`,
where the monomial `x*y` is the linear atom.

* Variables are represented by natural numbers.
* Monomials are represented by `monom := rb_map ℕ ℕ`. The monomial `1` is represented by the empty map.
* Linear combinations of monomials are represented by `sum := rb_map monom ℤ`.

All input expressions are converted to `sum`s, preserving the map from expressions to variables.
We then discard the monomial information, mapping each distinct monomial to a natural number.
The resulting `rb_map ℕ ℤ` represents the ring-normalized linear form of the expression.
This is ultimately converted into a `linexp` in the obvious way.

`linear_forms_and_vars` is the main entry point into this file. Everything else is contained.

`linear_form_of_expr red map e` computes the linear form of `e`.

`map` is a lookup map from atomic expressions to variable numbers.
If a new atomic expression is encountered, it is added to the map with a new number.
It matches atomic expressions up to reducibility given by `red`.

Because it matches up to definitional equality, this function must be in the `tactic` monad,
and forces some functions that call it into `tactic` as well.

`sum_to_lf s map` eliminates the monomial level of the `sum` `s`.

`map` is a lookup map from monomials to variable numbers.
The output `rb_map ℕ ℤ` has the same structure as `sum`,
but each monomial key is replaced with its index according to `map`.
If any new monomials are encountered, they are assigned variable numbers and `map` is updated.

`to_comp red e e_map monom_map` converts an expression of the form `t < 0`, `t ≤ 0`, or `t = 0`
into a `comp` object.

`e_map` maps atomic expressions to indices; `monom_map` maps monomials to indices.
Both of these are updated during processing and returned.

`linear_forms_and_vars red pfs` is the main interface for computing the linear forms of a list
of expressions. Given a list `pfs` of proofs of comparisons, it produces a list `c` of `comps` of
the same length, such that `c[i]` represents the linear form of the type of `pfs[i]`.

It also returns the largest variable index that appears in comparisons in `c`.
