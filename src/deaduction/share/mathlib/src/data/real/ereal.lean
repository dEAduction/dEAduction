# The extended reals [-∞, ∞].

This file defines `ereal`, the real numbers together with a top and bottom element,
referred to as ⊤ and ⊥. It is implemented as `with_top (with_bot ℝ)`

Addition and multiplication are problematic in the presence of ±∞, but
negation has a natural definition and satisfies the usual properties.
An addition is derived, but `ereal` is not even a monoid (there is no identity).

`ereal` is a `complete_lattice`; this is now deduced by type class inference from
the fact that `with_top (with_bot L)` is a complete lattice if `L` is
a conditionally complete lattice.

## TODO

abs : ereal → ennreal

In Isabelle they define + - * and / (making junk choices for things like -∞ + ∞)
and then prove whatever bits of the ordered ring/field axioms still hold. They
also do some limits stuff (liminf/limsup etc).
